# React.js Essential Training

I am refreshing my skills, including React, and this course by Eve Porcello of Moon Highway was short but sweet:
[React.js Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-js-essential-training/building-modern-user-interfaces-with-react?u=2045532).

Primarily worked in the App.js and index.js files under the src folder.
